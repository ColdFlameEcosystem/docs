<h2>1.2 Working of an OS</h2>
In this section I will tell you how actually an OS works. An operating system is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">wikipedia</a>. So, basically to that an OS have a kernel which basically communicate between the Hardware and the Softwares. Cold Flame OS is going to use Linux as it's kernel. 
<br><br>
To start an OS we need a bootloader, that executes the Kernel program from the storage device. In the case of Cold Flame we will use GRUB. Then bootloader will executes the kernel and then kernel will execute the programs. In the case of most linux Distributions. The first program that is executed is the init program. The init loads all the neccessary startup services and the User Interface. Most of the Linux Distributions have SystemD as their Init program developed by Red Hat. In the case of the Cold Flame we will use SystemD and a script named IgniteFlame. More about it later.
